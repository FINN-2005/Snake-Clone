# Snake Game

## Overview

This is a classic Snake game implementation. I developed this project because I realized I hadn't created it before, and it's a fundamental project for any game developer.  The game features procedurally generated visuals, meaning there are no external art assets.

## Key Features

* Classic Snake gameplay mechanics.
* Procedurally generated, runtime-drawn visuals (no external assets).
* Utilizes Pygame for graphics and event handling.

## Prerequisites

This project **requires** my custom Pygame framework, `pygame_template`, to function correctly. **This framework is currently hosted on my personal GitHub and will need to be installed directly from there.**

## Installation

1.  **Clone the Snake game repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/FINN-2005/Snake-Clone.git
    cd Snake-Clone
    ```

2.  **Install the `pygame_template` framework from GitHub:**

    * **Note:** As `pygame_template` is not available on PyPI, you will need to install it directly from my GitHub repository. The command will look something like this:

        ```bash
        pip install git+https://github.com/FINN-2005/pygame_template.git
        ```

## How to Run

1.  Navigate to the project directory (if you haven't already):

    ```bash
    cd Snake-Clone
    ```

2.  Run the game:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Important Notes

* The visuals in this project are generated at runtime.
* This project is built upon my custom `pygame_template` framework, which needs to be installed directly from my GitHub repository as outlined in the Installation section.

## Potential Improvements (Future Considerations)

* Add scoring and difficulty scaling.
* Include sound effects.
* Implement different game modes.
* Refactor code for better organization and readability.
* Publish `pygame_template` to PyPI for easier installation.
